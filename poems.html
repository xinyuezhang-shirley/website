						<h1>Poetry</h1>
						<p>Here are some poems I've written.</p>
						<blockquote>Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.<br>- J.D. Salinger, Catcher in the Rye</blockquote>

						</center>
						<center><h5><b> A Sonnet by Shirley Zhang</b></h5>
						</center>
						<center><p>
							Like autumn comes and leaves begin to blush <br>
							Like rains confess the wild’s restraining souls <br>
							Screams the rowdy youth of such fragile rush <br>
							Roars untamed minds from London to Seoul  <br> <br>
							
							Speak love, speak hate and He may laugh at thee<br>
							At crazed and blinded fixations like fame<br>
							But though He sings slow ballads to the sea<br>
							So does he mourn souls as unruly as Cain<br> <br>
							
							And look, oh look that flowers fall as well <br>
							and blushing leaves shower idlers in the fall<br>
							Like wind lies, like rain dies, like waves shall swell<br>
							Like flowers fall, like me, all things must befall<br> <br>
							
							Does Nature not die certain as shall I?<br>
							As Nature is beauty, I am alive.</p>

								<center><h2><b>Romantic Death- Linguistic Tragedy</b></h2>
									<h5><b> A Poem by Shirley Zhang</b></h5>
								</center>
								<center><p>
									That words flow from the tip of my tongue, <br>
									Lolita’s spell upon me. Each stair case another drawn <br>
									Out syllable, dancing, seducing my loss. Romantic. <br><br>
									
									Tragedy. <br>
									I speak not your language. I cannot<br>
									Waltz your steps, you curious soul.<br>
									I cannot caress the paragraphs like some long lost home, <br>
									For every grain of sand marks me foreign<br>
									alone in the wilderness, a mournful tone.<br>
									You will be the death of me, if not my lover<br>
									Each syllable a perfect rhyme with mine<br>
									Each sentence a centimeter more somber<br>
									Until I lie forever under your spells<br>
									Until I forever mistreat you as well. Still,<br>
									Your step a little lighter, and I willingly close<br>
									my eyes forever.<br><br>
									
									To live a romantic death, to suffer a beautiful tragedy. <br>
									Is this not the beauty of language? To die,<br>
									yet live, eternally?
