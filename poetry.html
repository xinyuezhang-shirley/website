						<h1>Poetry</h1>
						<p>Here are some poems I've written.</p>
						<blockquote>Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.<br>- J.D. Salinger, Catcher in the Rye</blockquote>

														<h3>Poetry</h3>
														<p>
															I've always thought that poetry was<br>
															some music for the soul.<br>
															It can break you and change you subtly thus,<br>
															as a stream caresses its pebbles, as gravity acts on Mars.<br><br>
															
															I was at that age when the raven knocked<br>
															at my chamber door,<br>
															and Poetry summoned me forward to decipher<br>
															her mysteries, whispered that I take on<br>
															the role of a riddler.<br><br>
															
															As a child, I wrote poetry because<br>
															it quelled a rowdy mind<br>
															with busy words and fancy diction.<br>
															That almost mocked me absurd. Unlearned<br>
															and naive that I was<br>
															to think that I can measure art<br>
															with syntax and rhyme.<br><br>
															
															How did they do it? Keats or Shakespeare<br>
															drew me closer to the music played between<br>
															my ears, behind my eyes, and you hear<br>
															the sounds of creativity-<br>
															deafening, soft, alluring thoughts<br>
															presented in the form of Poetry.<br><br>
															
															I have learned in the years of reading her<br>
															that to be a poet is to bribe<br>
															the reader with a piece<br>
															of your mind, raw and genuine<br>
															Not diction, not rhyme<br>
															But creativity.<br>
															
															And to hold the title of lead editor<br>
															here and there,<br>
															writer, though amateur,<br>
															fully self-aware<br>
															of my insufficiency, indelicacy,<br>
															but interest, and affair<br>
															with her honor Poetry.<br><br>
															
															Would it be cliche to say<br>
															that she guided me forward.<br>
															In the darkest of days, as I lay with her,<br>
															I find the strength to pray.<br><br>
															
															And amateur I was, and amateur I be,<br>
															but I find peace under the vastness of the sky<br>
															as I listen to her song<br>
															of creativity.<br>

														<h3>The Silent Thief</h3>
														<p>
														To be carried forward by the tide, <br>
														the crowd, its ruinous catastrophe, <br>
														to play the tune of the curious loss, <br>
														the tragic forfeit of identity,<br>
														I lose sight of the purpose <br>
														of my walk, my ever pacing <br>
														reality. Reality? <br> <br>
					
														An echo of myself became myself;<br>
														A version of knowledge betrayed knowledge.<br>
														On we march to a pure dystopian realm.<br>
														Complete thought, semicolon, complete<br> <br>
					
														distraught. Some nihilist reality, that is certain:<br>
														bondage through pain, bond by privilege<br>
														The plentiful nation of creativity’s ruination-<br>
														still painfully plain, still dreadfully average. <br> <br>
														
														Some time ago I’ve learned to suppress <br>
														my thoughts, in some unknown corners pressed<br>
														between the texts. Stressed, obsessed, <br>
														oppressed by his honor Success.<br>
														How seductive the concept, how luring the thought? <br> <br>
														
														Reality? Some time ago I lost myself<br>
														to the tide, the crowd. <br>
														I lost my wealth of power, my voice withheld<br>
														from myself. Who am I? <br> <br>
														
														A version of myself shattered myself and was me;<br>
														A tale of success replaced success and prevailed.<br>
														I have long lost sight of the purpose<br>
														of my walk, and yet I walk on<br>
														in my ever pacing reality.

														<h3>Ode to Life</h3>
														<p>
															Epigraph:<br>
															“I love that word. Forever. I love that forever doesn't exist, but we have a word for it anyway, and use it all the time. It's beautiful and doomed.”- Viv Albertine<br><br>
															
															Ode to Life<br>
															Hear: the soft song plays in the ears of all, that the phantom sound is clear. Like the golden-crowned <br>
															sparrow in the depth of fall, the melody rings in heavenly halls, the song: Forever <br><br>
															
															And God looked upon us with a pitying glance, for he had forever to spare, while men  <br>
															toiled through their purposeless endeavor, never aware of his Godly thought: Forever  <br><br>
															
															In our depth of agony, our souls can only sense- the doom of the scent so ominous, <br>
															the smell of death is near, his marching song, his mare. He charges on. Is death not Forever? <br><br>
															
															We lie in the coalbed of destiny, blind idiots we are, ripped into living, teared<br>
															apart, glued together, gifted pain and glory, is that the solemn song of Forever?<br><br>
															
															We collect jubilations to better our existence. We withdraw from pain, perpetual <br>
															resistance. Revolutionaries against destiny, and the terrors of Forever.<br><br>
															
															If my name ‘joy’, meant anything at all, perhaps it will bring me certainty that I shall <br>
															live in the tune of the golden-crowned sparrow, not tomorrow, but certainly forever.</p>

														So the system shuts down<br>
														Drown the pain, drown the worries<br>
														Fall asleep, stay asleep, or simply grow up<br>
														I hate being stupid, naive and young<br>
														I hate being sad, and stressed, and dumb<br><br>
														
														I hate it I truly hate it<br>
														How much I live inside my own head<br>
														How little control I have over myself<br>
														And how much everything else does instead<br><br>
														
														How do I live without feeling like dying<br>
														How do I be at peace with crying<br>
														Without knowing why the sorrows<br>
														Seem like they would be never ending<br><br>
														
														Is it truly that I am unsalvageable<br>
														Unteachable, unlovable<br>
														Or can I one day feel like living<br>
														without feeling like a burden to the world

														She is is a sadistic, seductive, solemn song<br>

														the pleasure of rushing adrenaline<br>
														the contentment of perfect fourth<br>
														the gaiety of childish whistles<br>
														the merriment of holiday warmth

													  <h3>When I Cannot Sleep</h3>
													  <p>
														When I cannot fall asleep<br>
														I feel the poison seep through my soul<br>
														A poison called “thoughts”<br>
														a long painful love sickness<br>
														a bland dreadful anxiety<br>
														painful solemn midnight silence<br>
														I have no tears to shed, nor words to spill<br>
														I have no inspirations to act, nor contemplations to grasp<br>
														Just a sudden pang of emotion stuck in my chest<br>
														that cannot quite clear off as I close my eyes<br>
														It’s like being heartbroken without ever loved<br>
														Being betrayed without ever trusted<br>
														Repent, dread, yearning, powerlessness<br>
														It’s like living a million lives in a single second<br>
														I think my soul just broke a little and pieced back together<br>
														and in that process I learned something I did not before<br>
														It is like the painful birth of creation <br>
														a silent epiphany in the darkness of the night<br>
														I do not know what I learned, but only that I know something others don’t <br>
														It’s strange because when you lie in bed<br>
														Your warmth seep through the bedsheets<br>
														as weariness seep through your mind<br>
														But you are not tired, you cannot sleep<br>
														Thoughts oh thoughts. Why so many?<br>
														Why am I burdened with such glorious pain as thinking? Who made it so?<br>
														I don’t like it; I don’t like thoughts<br>
														I have too many of them<br>
														I wish I can share some with the feeble minded<br>
														But they call me a narcissist <br>
														I wish I can share with the sad souls<br>
														But they call me naive<br>
														Only I can have my thoughts<br>
														But they burden me so, such a sweet, horrendous, burden

													  <p>
														On a Wednesday during a summer day,<br>
														The bitter cold reaches me nonetheless<br>
														Though I am in warmth, though I’m in brightness<br>
														Darkness envelops joy regardless <br>
														Remorseless, the rain. Thoughts like this reach me thus <br>
														I listen secretly to the falling rhythm, <br>
														Not very comforting, the rain.<br>
														With each pounding drop it interrogates me,<br>
														Each forceful tap it screams deceit,<br>
														Trying to wash away Earth’s sins,<br>
														Fighting to wipe away the footprints of the bird that landed here this morning, <br>
														the fingerprint I left yesterday, the colors, the scents. <br>
														Everything cease <br>
														to exist. <br>
														Only the guilty likes rain, the spoiled. See,<br>
														a hard restart is what they want, regardless of the feelings of others.

													  <p>
														While we stand at the edge of desolation,<br>
														is this voyage not a wonder in of itself?<br>
														Is there a true state of elation<br>
														without a side, a tint of misery as it’s counterpart still?<br>
														Arrive, then depart at the gate of sonder,<br>
														then jolt as the hand turns to twelve,<br>
														as if this magic eases morrow and morrow-year<br>
														as if there is a higher meaning to the self<br>
														Tilting frames, trodding travelers, ticking of the all powerful clock.<br>
														The glaciers will melt, and the clouds will kick, <br>
														as it does us, as does our minuscule existence, as flowers will wilt.<br>
														Close your eyes then, and count to three.<br>
														Forget this tomorrow, return to a state unfelt.<br>
														Weld your minuscule-ness as a weapon, and kill your way to enlightenment, till you find yourself

														Against the shadows he rung his note<br>
														Driving each and every one of us mad<br>
														Monsters we are we cried and bellowed <br><br>
														
														Then with the same wind he came in he left<br>
														Leaving painful silence to shatter<br>
														Until his back faded from our memories<br>
														then only those with the sign would stay
